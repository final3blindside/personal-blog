April was a wild ride. So much so that I was unable to attend to my blog and programming projects for a whole month. 

Even my last post was a recap!

<h3> Resume Update </h3>

Having completed my first Azure Certification [(AZ-305)](https://www.credly.com/badges/8d8e548f-2f0e-4823-9b43-ab1a389e11ad/public_url), I immediately inserted the badge on my Curriculum Vitae, where I have compiled all credentials I have obtained over the past 2 years. I realized that
even if my skills are geared towards clusters, either in writing, programming and finance; I needed to have a unified CV. Why? Because from there, I can create subsets of resumes that will be tailored to the job, internship, or program that I will apply for. I call it "[CV - Unified](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNZNRuumEhgQSM9wsu4Ep5A47F5mVIjAY7YZJnKFl4k/edit?usp=sharing)" and then I would change it's name to "Resume - Company/Program Name"

So far, I have created a Resume for the Shoppee Internship and for the MLH Fellowship. 
I will explain more of these later, but I believe I might not be able to get through.
At least, I demonstrated a successful use of my Unified CV system.
