I posted 17 days ago. Too long. That was also the amoutn of days since my I last touched any code. Let me explain why.

# February 4 - 10, 2023: Cousin Taking-Care Week

My cousins came over for a short stay. They are quite rowdy, but they are pretty manageable. I won't dive into their individual quirks. But I would dive into what they have shown me during those days.

I realized how our parents have managed us when we were younger. Children are curious, boisterous and straightforward. Traits which are used intensively on adults, would make adults exhausted in such a short span of time. Children know well how to use their respective traits and squeeze every last drop of them for fun use. 

And squeezed they did. Rhyme was talkative and curious. Both positive traits for a child. But too much of those are poison for introverts like me. Rhyme came here first and spent the longest time here. It means she was the one who squeezed the energy out of me.

Make no mistake! I do not hate my cousins. It's just that sometimes I can't match the energies they project. It eats away my social battery, making me exhausted. I'm sure all three of them would definitely rememeber me as the older cousin who is always tired (and tired looking!).

Children learn fast. The world, in their eyes, always has something to offer to them. Hence, they can devote a lot of time simmering in the experiences, feelings, and learnings they get from their surroundings. Eventually, they use what they learn to get what they want. It is at this point where we must take a closer look at how we treat and care for them.

Just one cry from Mic, and her siblings would immediately come to her rescue and "punish" the aggressor, or give her what she wants. Children can abuse this mentality, thinking that one holler from them is enough to bend the world according to their ideals.

Mom pointed this out. Of course it was her that had to point that out! She has a total of 21 years of taking care of children. Yunna and I have our differences, and that is enough for Mom to gain experience as a mother.

If that mentality of hers will stay, her mother and Mama will have a hard time facilitating her. She (almost all of them) doesn't usually get beatings as a form of discipline, which may (depending on how you look at it) or may not positively affect her attitude years later.


Another insight I gained from this week is my sister, whom I have always seen as my third grade sister who was always greasy and smelled like jeepney exhaust smokes everytime she comes home. She was the irritating one in the household, the one who needs the most solutions and the one who requires the most ears because she has a lot to say.

When our cousins came over, I can tell that she was experiencing how it feels to be an older sister. She can't make a move and do something silly, because every move she makes, Rhyme had something to say, something irritating to say. That went on until their last day here. Yunna was beginning to emit smoke through her scalp. Her temper was being tested. And on the test she passed (for me at least!)

I can tell now that she has grown and is a bit better than she was when she was a greasy third-grader. She is more silent, solves problems on her own (she tries her best), and (tries hard not to) shows that she can handle stress.

# February 12, 2022: AZ-305 Examination

Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform. That is my best explanation if asked what Azure is. But here's another thing I know. They have this Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program (which I haven't applied to yet, god knows how and when I will apply, hopefully by the end of this week), which led to me investigating about Microsoft certifications and other programs. They had this "Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge", which encouraged participants to finish a learning path in Microsoft Learn, and reeceive a voucher on selected exams. 

I completed the learning path I chose, which is "Designing Microsoft Azure Infarstructure Solutions", the corresponding exam of which is the AZ-305.

I didn't know anything about the exam. I didn't explore the PearsonVUE app until an hour before my scheduled exam. I just, went with it and took the exam without reviewing, nor refreshing myself on past topics. Imagine, I had almost 3 months of preparation, but I only attempted to review only during the penultimate hour. I am an expert at this.

The passing rate of the exam is 700/1000. I got a 726. Whew.

The exam is divided into two parts. One full of theoretical questions and the other an 8-question case study. I didn't know how I passed that exam. It was luck. My camera was also on during the whole exam.

So what is next? 

Well. The AZ-305 is just an exam. But it is one of two componenets for a certification.
The certification is the "Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Expert". It can be achieved by passing the AZ-305, and being an "Azure Administrator Associate", which can be obtained by passing the "AZ-104" exam.

I'm in too deep. And the certification is a waste if I don't pursue the entirety of it right? I mean the certificate is practically hard to take, the exam costs 90 dollars! I got it for free! I lost nothing there, so it's worth pursuing this certificate till the end.

The only thing stopping me from getting the Azure Solutions Architect Expert is the AZ-104, which is ironically the exam that I should have taken first before the AZ-305. I can self study, pay 90 dollars, and then take the exam. But of course, it would be better if I can also find a voucher for that exam as well. Hihi. Wish me luck.

I also have another voucher in the form of AWS-CP and AWS-SAA exams, which would expire this June and October, respectively. I need to do some underground studies, aside from my legit college studies, student leader activities, and creative endeavors. What a life. Vian, this is YOLO for me!

I will find a way. I want to have a lot of skills/experience/money by the time I graduate college. Cloud computing is just one of them.

# February 14, 2023: CEATSG Valentine's Day / Welcome Fest

I was tasked with assisting in the Marriage Booth. There was almost no one who participated in that booth. The Chain Booth was even worse. It had no one facilitating it, and so it became a non-existent booth by the time the event was halfway. What really attracted students were the free food (courtesy of stubs), which was the mist successful part of the event.

Being a student leader is tiring. It requires you to think on your feet and to stay away from distraction, because these distractions can cause you to lose great ideas.

I also helped during the day before and assisted with the creation of the set design. I was one of those who made the marriage booth arch, along with so many officers and jrcs.

My first two weeks as a jrc, I was a trainee under the Director of Outreach and Initiatives, now I will be training under the Director of Sports and Recreation. I will open his messages after I finish this.

# February 17, 2023: Data Analysis for Engineering Lab

First f2f of our second semester. While there is nothing new that came today. Lots of things can be felt. We lost two people already. Chico and Berry. Mom said College will make me know who I really am. It is fast. How many times do I have to mention that I am still culture shocked by college? Because the shock is endless.
