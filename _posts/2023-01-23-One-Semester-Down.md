Out of my 10 subjects during this first semester, there's two I am not so confident on having a good grade. First: Calculus 1 for Engineers and Chemistry for Engineers Lab. We all know I had come late during one of the lab days in Chemistry Lab. As for Calculus, my current grade sits on 3.50, Midterms and Finals included and under the impression that I had a perfect score in the Finals.

But I know I won't have a perfect score.

Calculus 1 Finals was a bit hard. I forgot how to get the inflection point. Problems involving that topic amounted to 12 points. I am just hoping that I pass.

As for Chemistry Lab, I got a 47/60, or 78.33%. I am really hoping that is enough to pull my late up.

The real target is having a 85% or 3.0 GWA, because that is 1) DOST's standard. and 2) Second Honors Eligiblity.

This next semester, I will study harder.

After spending one semester with us, Chico and Angge will be transferring out of the university. I guess this is how brutal college can be, and you can lose anyone, including yourself, anytime.

Chico will be trasnferring to De La Salle University - Manila because it is much nearer to his home at Para√±aque.

Angge will be leaving for the neighbor school, DLSHSI. I do not know the course she will take yet. 

Another news as well, our blocks might merge next semester. It is very probable as there are many irregulars students and transferring out such as Chico and Angge.

## What's next?

Later today, I will meet with Lance and Godi to discuss whether we can participate in the BPI AIA Lifehackers 2022 Hackathon. It's my nth time joining a hackathon, but it will hopefully be my first time to submit an entry as I am joined by my friends. All those past hackathons I have joined, I have joined alone, hence I have no one to work with.

On Wednesday, I will also participate in MIT'S IQuHack. Hopefully I also make a successful submission there.

Also on Wednesday, I will join a call in the OneQuantum Philippines.

Also this week or the next, I will be working on Contacting Suppliers for the SEDSPH Merch. 
(Yes, I have finally been aded to the group chats!)

Looking forward to complete the IT Automation using Python Course this sembreak, and then going back to advance study for the coming semester.
