I luckily passed my Calculus 2, Physics Lecture, Physics Lab and Materials Science & Engineering Classes.

Calculus was highest with 3.00
Physics Lab and Materials Science & Engineering with an unexpected 2.75
Physics Lecture with a nail-biting 2.50.

After the exam week, my head was filled with thoughts abut Physics Lecture only. I was so worried that the assignment I handed in would bring my grade down. Luckily, I passed and even got a perfect score on the assignment. The assignment was the make or break for Physics because I failed both the Midterms and Finals. 

As for Physics Lab and MSE, I was only expecting to get 2.5, but a 2.75 is not bad either. 
My Calculus Finals was good, I had 42/50, which is equivalent to 25.2 of my Final Term grade. 
Enough to pull my grades from 73 to around 90.

Altogether, they were enough to raise my grade from the ashes.
From a staggering line of 70-filled grades portal to a GPA or 3.34, I'd say the absence from all my other hobbies and cancellation of soo many plans was worth it. 

3.34 wasn't enough to reach First Honors, only a Second Honors position. In my case, it was good enough. Better than nothing and to those who even failed.

Speaking of failed, I remember during the Calculus 2 Final Exam, Adrian was caught looking at his cellphone. Since our subject teacher was not feeling well, the substitute teacher became our proctor. She was rather strict, according to my blockmates, because she even recorded Adrian even before she confronted him and reached for his paper to reveal his phone underneath. Other sources say the phone brightness was too high, making it too obvious for him.

Out of our block, I believe only Vian, Peona, and I had grades enough for the Dean's List.
I have no news from the other block, but I believe they were in risk of losing it because of their MSE Professor. So what the older batches were saying about the professor lottery was true?


That's it for my recap. Yes. June was all about studying and so I poured all my hours and sweat into studying the 4 subjects mentioned above. You and I can agree that it was worth it though.

Now that I'm thinking about why I spent almost 24/7 to studying these subjects, I learned one thing about myself. I am a slow learner. Vian, Peona, and I have different strategies for learning things.

Vian is the smart learner. She reads things beforehand AND makes things easier by doing tips and trick in learning.
Peona is the fast learner. She would always go with Vian to study in the library. More time han the rest of us. She picks things up fast and knows how to use it to her advantage.
And then there's myself, who is the hard learner. In order for myself to master something, I need to have come across it once, study it after sometime, practice here and there, watch Youtube videos, write and solve problems, all while the exam week is a month away. Yes, that's me.

While I do take pride for exerting great efforts to learn, I am annoyed that I am learning so slow as compared to those two. I want to be more efficient in learning, and so in preparation for the coming semester, I am planning the online resources that I will read and the study schedule I will follow. If I was only studying efficiently, I could get a GPA higher than 3.34. 

That's it for June, Hopefully, I can use all of July to build a better version of myself.

Earlier, I was rejected in my first ever job interview. They were looking for a full time worker. 
I'm a full time student.

The CEO was a bit gracious though, telling me to find them so I can work for them, especially with my Python background.

That makes me wonder: Why did they schedule me for an interview if they already saw my resume and pointed out that I'm a student? They already know what they were looking for, so why bother scheduling a call to see if "we're a good fit"? Why couldn't they just reject me through email? Isn't that better? 

Maybe I'm too young too know. At least, I have additional experience I can learn from. I'm just going to try again and see where I am a good "fit".
