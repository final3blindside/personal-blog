As part of the CEATSG, preparations came around for the NIRVANA. Ate Lexi was the project head. It was incredible how she handled all those different committees for the event. Before the event, I was assigned to the Picture booth. But since there was enough personnel to man the station, I was reassigned to the registration booth, where I had to tell all students to go to the RCC to claim their tickets. It was a bit hectic for those students. This issue was raised during the debriefing though.

The debriefing was every officer's chance to lay down any issue that transpired during the event. One of those was the registration booth happening at the RCC. I was assigned there after lunch. It was indeed hectic. Vian who usually looks bright, was pale by the end of the day. She was one of those operating the laptops for the registration. Aside from that, she was annoyed by a fellow officer who was assigned at the same station. There were also some officers who were verbally reprimanded during the debrieifing.

I didn't go to the debriefing, by the way. This was all relayed to me by my fello officers who were present at the meeting. I wasn't able to attend because 1) It was a Saturday, 2) The date and time was decided only a day before, which made it harder for me to seek permission from my mother to go; 3) Plus, it wouldn't be worth it to spend almost 300 pesos for me to attend a meeting where I will only look and hear different people's views and expressions, only to go straight home after.

<h2> Academics </h2>

If you didn't know already, our block was dissolved, and then created one again. This created a confusion in our Schoolbook accounts and made us late for some subjects. Peona, our block president, had to go the CILP numerous times to fix this issue. Since we were ECE12, enrolled in ECE11 classes, our professors who would meet us would always come in confused about the class attendance, schoolbook and MS Teams (basically everything about our block)

Peona had to raise this issue so many tireful times. Those days are next to gone now though. Most of our problems related to our block has dissipated, except for a few ones who don't have either a Schoolbook subject, MS Team group, or syllabus uploaded.

We are now in the stressful times era. I don't understand anything from our Calculus 2 classes, I keep forgetting the steps for each lab activity we do in Data Analysis for Engineering Lab, I always have subpar creative outputs in both English for Purposive Communication and Science, Technology, and Society; I don't understand anything from Physics Lecture, My hands and head hurt from writing lab reports for Physics Lab, Nothing in Data Analysis for Engineering Lecture stays in my head for too long, REED is ok, PE is stressful because I am not good at dancing and just lucky to have ten YouTube accounts subscribed to my instructor. SEPR is a pain in the eyes, I have to go out of my way just to attend activities for this subject. Materials Science and Engineering is ok except for the enabling assessment where we had to make a presentation but the professor didn't flesh out the rubric he made, and Applied Engineeing Sciences is almost non-existent at this point. The professor is going through a rough patch in his life right now.

No sarcasm involved, I hope he gets through this just fine.

With the Transport strike and Holy Week coming through our midterms, we don't have a lot of time to catch up on the lessons. This is much more daunting to know when you realize that our midterm exams comes around two weeks after the Holy Week. Its Woly Heek!

Perspire was another event of the CEATSG. Kuya Rj is the project head. Tomorrow is the last day. There are so many things to say about this event. There were so many disorganizaion among the officers and miscommunication. It was so hard to move forward with the project. Even the event itself was postponed 2 times. The Sponsorship broke down. I was one of the first people who worked on this sub-task. It was indeed hard to find sponsors for the event. In fact, for any event. The fact that we are still under a Pandemic makes this worse. 

Out of 200+ businesses we contacted, only 5 responded and showed interest. Only for all of those partnerships to be cancelled a few days into the event. What a shame. Peona and Vian pushed to make those partnerships happen, but it would be cancelled just because of numerous technicalities in the paperworks, processes, and timeline. 

I know those two are keeping tabs on what to say during the debriefing. What I know for sure is that as compared to NIRVANA, PERSPIRE will have loads of more. Let's wait and see.

I am Ate Trisha's trainee, so I mostly contributed before the event itself, helping plan the posting of pubs, and making sure that the publication content tracker is on time and being followed by the Director of Creatives' Committee.

Since she also handled the opening day's floor directing, I was also down there doing some floor directing, especially directing the candidates on where and how they will step on the stage. I'm a bit guilty tho, I wasn't able to help in the succeeding days. The last day is tomorrow, which is the closing ceremonies. 

Bless me and my CEATSG future. With different Junior Councillors already gearing up to take positions next year, I know for sure that I might remain as a Junior Councillor next year. 

Personally, I don't know what to feel about that.
Realistically, I know what to feel about that.

I should feel ok, because as compared to others' contributions, mine are minuscule. I am fine.

Two Lasallian souls have died in the past month. One because of a plane crash, and another because of a forced entry robbery. Her name is Queen Leanne Daguinsin. She came from Pila, Laguna and is graduating after this term. What a sad ending to her life. I cannot imagine what was going through her head in her final moments. How about the family she left behind? Her killer doesn't know what damage he has done to the woman's family. He is living without a soul. Her killer has been found a few hours before writing this post. May the following days bring her justice and her family peace. May she rest in peace.

Because of this, security measures in and around the university were tightened. This incident also brought less support from my mother in myself living in a dorm near the university. Nice. But I understand her.

No progress in my upskilling campaign, No progress in any other extracurricular activity.
The only real highlight I can give you is this: 

I survived another month.

I'm just a normal person.

But I want to be better than this.
